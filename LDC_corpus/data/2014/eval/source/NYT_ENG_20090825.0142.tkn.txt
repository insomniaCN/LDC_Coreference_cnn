HAWAII TO REMOVE INMATES OVER SEX ABUSE CHARGES 
< / HEADLINE>

Hawaii prison officials said Tuesday that all of the state 's 168 
female inmates at a privately run Kentucky prison will be removed 
by the end of September because of charges of sexual abuse by 
guards . Forty inmates were returned to Hawaii on Aug . 17 .

This month , officials from the Hawaii Department of Public 
Safety traveled to Kentucky to investigate accusations that inmates 
at the prison , the Otter Creek Correctional Center in Wheelwright , 
including seven from Hawaii , had been sexually assaulted by the 
prison staff .

Otter Creek is run by the Corrections Corporation of America and 
is one of a spate of private , for - profit prisons , mainly in the 
South , that have been the focus of investigations over issues like 
abusive conditions and wrongful deaths . Because eastern Kentucky is 
one of the poorest rural regions in the country , the prison was 
welcomed by local residents desperate for jobs .

Hawaii sent inmates to Kentucky to save money . Housing an inmate 
at the Women 's Community Correctional Center in Kailua , Hawaii , 
costs $ 86 a day , compared with $ 58.46 a day at the Kentucky prison , 
not including air travel .

Hawaii investigators found that at least five corrections 
officials at the prison , including a chaplain , had been charged 
with having sex with inmates in the last three years , and four were 
convicted . Three rape cases involving guards and Hawaii inmates 
were recently turned over to law enforcement authorities . The 
Kentucky State Police said another sexual assault case would go to 
a grand jury soon .

Kentucky is one of only three states -- the others are Iowa and 
Maryland -- where it is a misdemeanor rather than a felony for a 
prison guard to have sex with an inmate , according to the National 
Institute of Corrections , a policy arm of the Justice Department . A 
bill to increase the penalties for such sexual misconduct failed to 
pass in the Kentucky legislature this year .

The private prison industry has generated extensive controversy , 
with critics arguing that incarceration should not be contracted to 
for - profit companies . Several reports have found contract 
violations at private prisons , safety and security concerns , 
questionable cost savings and higher rates of inmate recidivism .
" Privately operated prisons appear to have systemic problems in 
maintaining secure facilities , " a 2001 study by the Federal Bureau 
of Prisons concluded .

Proponents say privately run prisons provide needed beds at 
lower cost . About 8 percent of state and federal inmates are held 
in such prisons , according to the Justice Department .
