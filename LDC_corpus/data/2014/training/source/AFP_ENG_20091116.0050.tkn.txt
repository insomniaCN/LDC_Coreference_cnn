A Zambian journalist was acquitted Monday of pornography charges after emailing unpublished pictures of a woman giving birth on the sidewalk outside a hospital during a doctors ' strike .
< / P> 
<P> 
Chansa Kabwela , news editor of the private Post newspaper , could have been jailed for five years over the case which had raised concerns about media freedom in Zambia .
< / P> 
<P> 
Magistrate Charles Kafunda said prosecutors had failed to prove the case against the journalist at the most influential paper in the southern African country .
< / P> 
<P> 
" The prosecution failed to establish an element of a prima facie case and I therefore dismiss the case and subsequently acquit the accused . The state has however the right to appeal , " Kafunda told a packed courtroom .
< / P> 
<P> 
Kabwela , dressed in a black suit and accompanied by her husband Henry , smiled as Kafunda read out the verdict .
< / P> 
<P> 
She later told reporters outside the court that her acquittal was a victory for everyone affected by the doctors ' strike , which lasted two weeks in June .
< / P> 
<P> 
" This victory to me is a victory for those that suffered during the strike . I was confident that I would be acquitted , " Kabwela said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Kabwela was charged over graphic images of a child born in the breech position , after the family was turned away from the hospital due to the strike .
< / P> 
<P> 
The baby died . The woman 's family emailed Kabwela the pictures , asking her to publish them to highlight the suffering caused by the striking public hospital doctors , who earn as little as 400 dollars ( 270 euros ) a month .
< / P> 
<P> 
Kabwela decided the pictures were too graphic to publish . But she emailed them to Vice President George Kunda and women 's organisations , with a brief message urging them to take action .
< / P> 
<P> 
The images outraged President Rupiah Banda , who ordered that she be arrested for distributing obscene images .
< / P> 
<P> 
She was charged with circulating pornography with intent to corrupt public morals .
< / P> 
<P> 
Lead prosecutor Frank Mumbuna said no decision had been taken on whether to appeal .
< / P> 
<P> 
" I can not say what is next from here , it 's just too early to say anything , " Mumbuna said .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Press Association of Zambia said that the state never had grounds to arrest and charge Kabwela , adding the whole exercise was a waste of time .
< / P> 
<P> 
" We only regret that the government spent so much time on an issue that the media association and the central government would have sorted out without going to court , " said the group 's vice president Amos Chanda .
< / P> 
<P> 
But he added that he was happy that the judiciary had operated without any interference from the government .
< / P> 
<P> 
" The judiciary has shown us that they can be independent at times , " Chanda said .
< / P> 
<P> 
Henry Kabwe , Zambia chairman of the Media Institute of Southern Africa , welcomed the acquittal but accused the government of politicising the case with Banda 's order to arrest Kabwela .
< / P> 
<P> 
" This is a progressive judgment and it has shown the independence of the judiciary , " Kabwe said .
< / P> 
<P> 
The New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists said it was pleased the journalist had been cleared of the " spurious charge " .
< / P> 
<P> 
The case sparked intense debate about what constitutes pornography in this deeply conservative country .
< / P> 
<P> 
Tensions erupted into clashes in August when supporters of Banda fought on the court grounds with opposition activists who sympathised with Kabwela . After the incident protesters were banned from the court .
