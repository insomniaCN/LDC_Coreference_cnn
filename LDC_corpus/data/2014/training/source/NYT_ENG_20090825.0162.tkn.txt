<HEADLINE> 
THE PLANET , A WEB - HOSTING COMPANY , FINDS ITS OWN ORBIT 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
HOUSTON -- Three years ago , investors bought two stagnant 
Web - hosting 
companies and merged them into what is now known as The Planet .
< / P> 
<P> 
They tasked newly appointed CEO Doug Erwin with melding two 
different 
corporate cultures , turning profits and taking the company public .
Observers say he 's done well by hitting two out of three .
< / P> 
<P> 
" IPOs are not a possibility at the moment " for anyone , said 
Dan Golding , 
vice president of Tier 1 Research , " so that 's not a negative for 
them , 
necessarily . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
" The real value is that they took two firms that had really 
sort of 
plateaued and put them together successfully . That 's a very 
difficult 
trick to do . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
The privately held company wo n't disclose net income figures but 
said 
its annual revenue runs about $ 150 million . When the two companies 
merged , they had combined revenues of less than $ 100 million , 
officials 
said .
< / P> 
<P> 
The merger 
< / P> 
<P> 
GI Partners , a California - based private equity firm , bought 
Houston 's 
EV1 Servers whose sister dial - up business Everyones Internet was 
sold 
off and Dallas - based The Planet separately . It joined the two in 
2006 , 
eventually making Houston the company 's headquarters .
< / P> 
<P> 
News of the merger between EV1 and The Planet was n't greeted by 
each 
company 's employees with much enthusiasm .
< / P> 
<P> 
They were also dealing with new top management , including Erwin .
< / P> 
<P> 
Employees in each city considered their business practices 
better , Erwin 
said . So he had employees from Dallas and Houston meet at a 
gymnasium in 
Crockett for a competition .
< / P> 
<P> 
He gave each employee 10 toy bricks and told them to build 
something .
Whoever built the most creative sculpture would get to pick where 
the 
piece would sit in the company 's new downtown Houston offices .
< / P> 
<P> 
After discovering they could n't build much with 10 bricks each , 
the 
employees formed teams to build a construction zone , a server , a 
pyramid 
and other sculptures , all of which are on display at the 
headquarters in 
Bayou Place .
< / P> 
<P> 
" I told them we were rebuilding the company brick by brick , " 
Erwin said .
Some from Dallas ended up winning , " so every time the Houston 
folks walk 
in , they have to look at it . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
New markets 
< / P> 
<P> 
Aside from getting employees to get along , the new management 
also had 
to make the company profitable and expand it .
< / P> 
<P> 
First , they used the combined company 's buying power to 
renegotiate 
contracts with everyone from the utility company to Dell , which 
provides 
all of The Planet 's servers .
< / P> 
<P> 
The company cut costs enough to turn a profit within a year of 
the 
merger .
< / P> 
<P> 
Last year it also moved from solely renting servers used to host 
Web 
sites and run applications to managing the servers for businesses , 
competing with companies like San Antonio - based Rackspace Hosting .
< / P> 
<P> 
Late last year , The Planet entered the cloud storage space 
storage 
accessed from anywhere via the Web and started renewed efforts to 
push 
its co-location services , which is essentially renting space in 
data 
centers for companies that want to locate servers off site .
< / P> 
<P> 
Today , 50 percent of the company 's revenue comes from services 
neither 
company offered before the merger .
< / P> 
<P> 
" We 've achieved our growth , " finance chief Kevin Klausmeyer 
said . He 
added that the company is targeting small to medium - size 
businesses .
Almost half of its customers are overseas .
< / P> 
<P> 
Growth has slowed since September as the economy declined , he 
said , but 
the company still managed to secure a $ 45 million credit line in 
October 
that it has never used .
< / P> 
<P> 
But sustaining growth while introducing new products could prove 
challenging , Golding said . Last year , for instance , an outage 
caused by 
a fire at one of its Houston data centers knocked the sites of 
about 
8,000 customers offline . The company waived monthly fees for its 
customers for two months and is trying to recover the lost income , 
more 
than $ 3 million , from its insurance company .
< / P> 
<P> 
" When you 're growing at the pace they 're growing , you 're going 
to run 
into problems you 're never going to see , " Golding said . " Your 
customers 
expect you to execute perfectly . They also need to introduce new 
products and hit the cloud computing wave . Doing all that at the 
pace 
they 're growing is tough . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
Going public ? 
< / P> 
<P> 
Whether the company eventually goes public does n't matter , Erwin 
said .
He 's running the company as if it were , he added .
< / P> 
<P> 
Erwin ran Houston - based blade server company RLX Technologies 
with 
Klausmeyer before Hewlett - Packard Co. bought it in 2005 .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Whether we go public or not , time will tell , " said Erwin .
" But that 's 
how you add value . I 've done this four times before , and we never 
made 
it to the altar . It always got sold . "
