A body found buried in a backyard has been identified as a man who won millions of dollars in the Florida lottery , then vanished last year .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Hillsborough County Sheriff 's office said Friday the remains were identified through fingerprints as Abraham Shakespeare . The cause of death was not immediately determined .
< / P> 
<P> 
The body was found Thursday at a home connected to a woman who had befriended him , and authorities have characterized the case as a homicide .

Shakespeare , 43 , disappeared in April _ though he was n't reported missing until November . He had won a lottery jackpot in 2006 , opting for a lump sum payment of nearly $ 17 million .

<P> 
The remains were found at a home owned by the boyfriend of Dorice Moore . Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd has previously called Moore a " person of interest , " though she has not been charged .

<P> 
On Dec . 5 , Moore told The Ledger newspaper that she helped Shakespeare disappear , but now wants him to return because detectives were searching her home and car and looking for blood on her belongings .

<P> 
Judd has said Moore transferred more than $ 1 million from Shakespeare 's bank account into hers . She said the money was a gift .
< / P> 
<P> 
Shakespeare had a criminal record that included arrests and prison time for burglary , battery and not paying child support . He used his winnings to buy a Nissan Altima , a Rolex from a pawn shop and a $ 1 million home in a gated community _ but the money quickly caused him more problems .

<P> 
A former co-worker sued him in 2007 , accusing Shakespeare of stealing the winning ticket from him . Six months later , a jury ruled the ticket was Shakespeare 's . And his mother , Elizabeth Walker , has said others were constantly asking Shakespeare for a piece of his fortune .
< / P> 
<P> 
Not long after he bought the million - dollar home in early 2007 , he was approached by Moore , family and sheriff 's officials have said . She became something of a financial adviser , and property records showed that her company bought Shakespeare 's house in January 2009 .
