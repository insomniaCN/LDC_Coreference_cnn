A court on Saturday sentenced a female Saudi journalist to receive 60 lashes for her links with a Saudi - owned Lebanese TV network which broadcast a provocative racy show in July .

<P> 
Rosanna al - Yami said a Jeddah judge dropped all charges that she had been directly involved with a programme on Beirut - based network LBC in which a Saudi man boasted of his sex life , outraging Saudi conservatives and leading to the man 's imprisonment .

<P> 
However , Yami said the judge sentenced her to 60 lashes for having been a part - time employee for LBC 's Saudi operations . The judge said that LBC had lacked the appropriate operating license .

" It 's a punishment for all journalists through me , " Yami told AFP by telephone .

" They just said the channel was illegal . But the Saudi minister of information himself appeared on LBC a couple week ago , " she said .

Yami 's sentencing comes after airline sales clerk Mazen Abdul Jawad was convicted of offensive behaviour and sentenced to five years in jail and 1,000 lashes on October 7 for his July appearance on the LBC show " Bold Red Line " in which he talked about picking up girls and having sex with them .
