NAIROBI , Nov . 25 ( Xinhua ) -- International Finance Corporation 
( IFC ) has signed agreements with three partners to expand access 
to insurance to thousands of farmers and livestock herders in 
Kenya and Rwanda to help protect their crops , animals and 
livelihoods from weather - related risks and natural disasters .
< / P> 
<P> 
IFC , through the Global Index Insurance Facility ( GIIF ) , will 
confer grants totaling roughly 4.1 million U.S. dollars to the 
Syngenta Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture / UAP Insurance 
weather index insurance initiative in Kenya ; the International 
Livestock Research Institute ( ILRI ) Livestock index insurance 
project in northern Kenya ; and the MicroEnsure weather index 
insurance project in Rwanda . " These partnerships highlight 
IFC 's commitment to expanding insurance and other financial 
products where they are needed most in Africa . The Global Index 
Insurance Facility will facilitate farmers ' access to credit , 
leading to increased productivity , improved livelihoods and 
greater food security , " Jean Philippe Prosper , IFC Director for 
Eastern and Southern Africa said . " We are grateful to the 
donors that have generously provided funding and to our partners 
for supporting this program . "

<P> 
The grants , the first three provided under the GIIF program , will 
help bring weather - related , index - based insurance to about 35 , 
000 farmers and 5,000 livestock herders in East Africa over the 
next three years . " The implementation of these three first GIIF 
projects in Kenya and Rwanda will support the development of new 
insurance products and will increase expertise in this field , 
which will benefit smallholders and livestock keepers affected by 
climatic events , " he said . " In addition to the GIIF , the 
European Union is providing further financing to the ILRI 
Livestock Insurance project in Kenya through the 10th European 
Development Fund , Kenya Rural Development Project that will start 
in 2011 . "

IFC will confer a grant of up to 2.4 million dollars on Syngenta 
Foundation for Sustainable Agriculture , which expects to help 
insure 20,000 farmers in Kenya over the next three years 
< / P> 
<P> 
IFC will confer a grant of up to 154,000 dollars on the ILRI , 
which expects to help insure 5,000 livestock herders in northern 
Kenya over the next two years .

<P> 
IFC will confer a grant of up to 1.6 million dollars on 
MicroEnsure , which expects to insure 15,000 farmers in Rwanda 
over the next three years .

<P> 
IFC 's GIIF program was established in 2009 to assist the 
development of index - based insurance for natural disasters and 
weather risks in developing countries , where insurance is rarely 
available .
< / P> 
<P> 
The grants will fund advisory activities , including local 
capacity building , infrastructure development , product 
development , and development of local insurance companies ' 
capacity to provide index - based insurance products .
< / P> 
<P> 
Index - based insurance insures against catastrophic events , such 
as wind storms or droughts , depending on their severity .
< / P> 
<P> 
Index - linked insurance products eliminate the need for insurance 
companies to individually verify claims , reducing transaction 
costs and making it easier for the products and services to be 
offered to rural communities and in frontier regions .
< / P> 
<P> 
The European Union committed 24.5 million euros as the first 
donor to the GIIF Trust Fund .
< / P> 
<P> 
The fund is also supported by Japan 's Ministry of Finance with an 
initial grant of 2 million dollars , and the Dutch Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs , which provided funding to establish the 
facility .
