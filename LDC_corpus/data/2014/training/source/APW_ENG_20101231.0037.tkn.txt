Protests against a sharp increase in fuel prices intensified and turned violent in Bolivia on Thursday , as thousands of demonstrators demanded President Evo Morales' government repeal the hike .

Demonstrators filled the streets in La Paz and other cities to protest the higher prices , which were announced suddenly on Sunday , prompting an immediate 73 percent jump in gasoline prices and an 83 percent rise in prices for diesel . It also led to rapid increases in transport and food prices in the Andean country .

Some demanded the resignation of Morales , a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez . It has been the most unpopular measure of Morales' five - year presidency .

Taxi drivers held a strike that largely paralyzed La Paz on Thursday , and protests were also held in the cities of Cochabamba , Santa Cruz , Potosi and Oruro .

The march in the capital began peacefully but clashes with police erupted when demonstrators tried to enter the main plaza where the government palace is located .

Fuel prices had been frozen for six years , but the government said it could no longer afford to subsidize them , especially since much is smuggled across the border to neighboring countries .

Responding to the protests , Morales' government has announced steps aimed at mitigating the economic effects _ including 20 percent salary increases for public workers aimed at offsetting higher fuel prices . The government also announced new assistance to rice , corn and wheat farmers intended to increase production and bring down prices .

Demonstrators have called their protest the " gasolinazo . "

Neighborhood protest leader Claudio Luna said in La Paz that the government 's " message has n't met the expectations of the population , and for that reason we 're going to continue the protests . " He said demonstrators want prices lowered back to their former levels .

Bus drivers have also held sporadic protests this week , demanding the government further increase fares . Authorities ordered raises of 60 to 80 percent in public transport fares , but bus drivers argue that is n't enough to offset the higher costs .

Food prices have also risen 15 percent in subsidized government markets , but that remained much less than in private supermarkets . People seeking bargains lined up at a state - run food store in La Paz on Thursday .

Morales , meanwhile , said in a news conference that he is inviting advisers from Paraguay 's government to help formulate additional measures to lessen the blow of eliminating fuel subsidies .
