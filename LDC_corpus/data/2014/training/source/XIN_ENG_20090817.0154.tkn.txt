LUSAKA , Aug . 17 ( Xinhua ) -- Zambia 's former president Frederick 
Chiluba , who had been accused of embezzling 500,000 U.S. dollars 
in public funds , was cleared of his corruption charges on Monday .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Lusaka magistrate 's court ruled that Chiluba was of no guilty 
of all the 12 charges against him in the case .
< / P> 
<P> 
The trial started early in the morning and lasted for six hours 
before the ruling was announced by Judge Jones Chinyama . Jones 
Chinyama said the prosecution team had failed to prove the case 
against Chiluba .

<P> 
The judge said that an important attestor failed to show up 
during the trial , adding that " I find that the accused is not 
guilty on all counts . "

Chiluba 's corruption case closed in March this year and judgment 
was set for July 20 this year .

But the judgment was last month deferred to August 14 in light of 
the consent judgment passed to allow Chiluba file his submissions 
out of the court 's time .

On Aug . 14 , the case was postponed again to August 17 , with the 
reason of " the judge is not ready " then .
