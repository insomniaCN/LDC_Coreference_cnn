BRASILIA , Dec . 17 ( Xinhua ) -- The Brazilian Supreme Federal Court 
Thursday suspended the return of 9 - year - old Sean Goldman to the 
United States , where his father lives .
< / P> 
<P> 
Marco Aurelio de Mello , a judge of the supreme court , shelved the 
Wednesday decision of the Federal Regional Court of Rio de 
Janeiro to send Goldman , saying the will of the child himself 
must be heard and made known .
< / P> 
<P> 
Thus , Sean must remain in Brazil at least until 2010 , as the 
court will recess from Monday .

<P> 
Sean is son of the U.S. man David Goldman with the Brazilian 
woman Bruna Bianchi , who brought him to her country five years 
ago under the pretext of a vacation .

<P> 
Bianchi got divorced from Goldman and married a lawyer in Brazil .
But in August 2008 , she died from complications in childbirth .

Since the mother 's death , the custody of the child has been 
disputed between the father and the Brazilian family .

Even U.S. President Barack Obama requested his Brazilian 
counterpart Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to help realize Sean 's 
return to the United States .
