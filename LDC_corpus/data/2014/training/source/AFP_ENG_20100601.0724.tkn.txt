Chinese President Hu Jintao has called on the entire nation to do more to ensure the safety of children , state press said Tuesday , in comments that follow a spate of grisly school killings .
< / P> 
<P> 
" The entire society must pay importance to the safety of children and do everything to safeguard our motherland 's next generation , " the People 's Daily quoted Hu as saying .
< / P> 
<P> 
Hu was speaking Monday as he toured a Beijing exhibit on transport and building safety with a group of schoolchildren on the eve of International Children 's Day , the report said .

<P> 
His remarks come after a spate of bloody school attacks around China since late March which have left 17 people dead , including 15 students , and scores injured .
< / P> 
<P> 
Experts say the senseless assaults reveal a China struggling to come to grips with rapid social change following decades of booming economic growth .

On Sunday , a 47 - year - old unemployed man was executed for carrying out an assault on 32 people , mostly small children , at a kindergarten in eastern China in April . The man , Xu Yuyuan , wielded a knife usually used to slaughter pigs .
< / P> 
<P> 
Xu , who was sentenced to death on May 15 , told the court his motive was to vent his rage against society after losing money gambling and in business dealings , and suffering setbacks in his personal life .

In late April , a former doctor who stabbed eight schoolchildren to death in a March school attack was executed .
< / P> 
<P> 
Two other school assailants have committed suicide .
< / P> 
<P> 
Premier Wen Jiabao said last month that long - standing social concerns including joblessness and a gaping rich - poor divide were partially to blame for the string of attacks .
< / P> 
<P> 
" We need to resolve the deep - seated causes that have resulted in these problems , " Wen said in an interview with Hong Kong - based Phoenix Television .
< / P> 
<P> 
" This includes handling social contradictions , resolving disputes and strengthening mediation at the grassroots level . "
