The Obama administration 's critics are missing the point on Ahmed Ghailani . Their reaction to his acquittal this week on 284 criminal counts and conviction on only one exaggerates both the vices of civilian courts and the virtues of military commissions . And it elides an important alternative to trial in either forum - military detention without trial - that today looks more attractive than ever as a means for incapacitating terrorists .
< / P> 
<P> 
The decision by the Manhattan federal court jury Wednesday in the case of the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Africa - the first federal court trial of a Guantanamo detainee - has triggered a predictable political backlash against President Obama . The prosecution was designed to showcase the feasibility of terrorist trials in civilian courts . Instead , it has turned into a near - miss that highlights the risks of those cases .
< / P> 
<P> 
In response , Rep. Peter King , R - N . Y . , sounded a common theme in demanding that the Obama administration " abandon its ill - advised plan to try Guantanamo terrorists " in federal court - which he termed " absolute insanity " - and in insisting that terrorists instead face trial in military commissions . This is the wrong lesson to draw from this case .
< / P> 
<P> 
The government had a difficult time convicting Ghailani in large part because presiding Judge Lewis Kaplan excluded a key witness that the government had acknowledged it knew about through coercive interrogations . Many critics of civilian trials claim that this problem would not have occurred in a military commission , but that is very probably wrong . The legal standard for excluding such evidence in military commissions would depend on the military judge 's sense of the " interests of justice . " The government would be foolish to rely on military judges ' willingness to admit evidence obtained - even in a derivative fashion - as a result of coercion . There is not much reason to think that the government would have had an easier time against Ghailani on this score if it had proceeded in a commission .
< / P> 
<P> 
There is , however , reason to think that a commission trial would have presented problems not present in Ghailani 's civilian trial . One central problem is that the conspiracy charge on which Ghailani was nabbed might not be valid in military commissions ; three sitting Supreme Court justices have said as much , and many scholars agree . On this and other issues from evidentiary and procedural rules to fundamental constitutional questions , military commissions raise legal uncertainties that have yet to be sorted out by appellate courts . Civilian courts , by contrast , are tried and true . They have produced a great many terrorist convictions , and a verdict in one is much easier to defend on appeal .
< / P> 
<P> 
While the Ghailani verdict does not argue for military commissions over civilian trials , it does highlight the attraction of military detention without trial at all . This is the traditional ground on which enemy soldiers have been held in wartime . The government has a lesser burden in justifying military detention before a habeas corpus court than it has in convicting a terrorist of a crime at trial . The courts broadly accept that Congress has authorized military detention and that it is a perfectly legitimate form of terrorist incapacitation . Yet the Obama administration , while embracing the legality and necessity of military detention , has expressed a strong preference for trials instead . The Post reported last weekend that the administration is rethinking that stance with respect to the Sept . 11 conspirators , and Ghailani 's verdict should spur that reconsideration .
< / P> 
<P> 
A year ago , Attorney General Eric Holder said in connection with trying the Sept . 11 cases in a civilian court : " Failure is not an option . These are cases that have to be won . I do n't expect that we will have a contrary result . " But the Ghailani prosecution illustrates , and any fair trial assumes , that failure is indeed an option .
< / P> 
<P> 
Imagine that Ghailani had been acquitted on all counts . The administration would then have faced a terrible choice between releasing him or - as the attorney general and Judge Kaplan have said is possible - continuing to hold him in military detention indefinitely despite his acquittal . The first option would be unsafe for the nation and suicidal politically . The second option would look terrible in light of an acquittal and would harm the legitimacy of every subsequent terrorist trial .
< / P> 
<P> 
This terrible choice - which came close to becoming a reality - reveals why military detention is fundamental and appropriate here . The reason the first option is unsafe and the second option is available is that Ghailani helped conduct a major terrorist operation on behalf of a group with which the country is at war . Military detention was designed precisely to prevent such fighters from returning to the battlefield . It is a tradition - sanctioned , congressionally authorized , court - blessed , resource - saving , security - preserving , easier - than - trial option for long - term terrorist incapacitation .
< / P> 
<P> 
This is not , we want to emphasize , an argument that either civilian trials or military commissions are illegitimate venues for terrorist trials or that they should never be used . Rather , it is a pragmatic argument in favor of a lawful alternative whose use , given the difficult events of the past nine years , now makes more sense than trial in any forum for a dwindling group of Guantanamo detainees whose prosecutions are more trouble and risk than they 're worth .
