Workers at a bankrupt French car parts factory Monday dropped a threat to blow up the plant unless they get a lay - off settlement from their former clients Renault and Peugeot .

Around 100 workers voted to remove a ring of gas canisters from the plant in central - eastern Chatellerault , which they have occupied since their employer New Fabris was declared bankrupt on June 16 .

The workers were threatening to blow up the factory and its stock of parts on July 31 unless Renault and PSA - Peugeot -- who accounted for 90 percent of their business -- paid 30,000 euros to each of the 366 laid - off employees .

French Industry Minister Christian Estrosi agreed to open talks with a delegation of workers , but only on condition they dropped their threats .

The New Fabris threats sparked two copycat incidents last week , as laid - off workers at other firms sought to grab the media spotlight .

US construction equipment maker Oshkosh agreed to pay extra redundancy money to workers at a French branch , JLG Industries , after they warned they would blow up gas canisters at the plant .

Laid - off workers at telecoms firm Nortel Networks near Paris also briefly threatened to blow up their factory in a dispute over redundancy pay , before backing down the following day .

The blast threats follow a wave of " bossnappings " in which French workers took their managers hostage as bargaining chips in negotiations over factory closures .

The French government raised the tone over the radical tactics last week , accusing the workers of " blackmail , " but stopped short of sending in police .
