US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Sunday she had raised with Azerbaijani authorities the issue of two jailed bloggers whose case has increased concerns over media freedom in the ex-Soviet republic .
< / P> 
<P> 
Clinton said that despite " considerable progress " with regards to freedoms in Azerbaijan , " there are still lots of challenges " .
< / P> 
<P> 
" President ( Barack ) Obama and I have both received many letters about the two young bloggers who are in prison . I 've certainly raised those in my meetings today , " she told a youth roundtable after meeting with Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Democracy is not only about elections , " Clinton said , adding that " new technologies and social media can help the democratic dialogue . "

The two bloggers , Adnan Hajizade and Emin Milli , were arrested and jailed on hooliganism charges last year shortly after posting an Internet video of a donkey giving a press conference , lampooning the country 's docile press and statements by government officials .
< / P> 
<P> 
Hajizade , 26 , was jailed for two years and Milli , 30 , for two - and - a - half years .
< / P> 
<P> 
The charges related to a scuffle in a restaurant but the bloggers and rights groups say the arrests were politically motivated .
< / P> 
<P> 
Authorities have said the charges were unrelated to the bloggers ' criticism of the government .
< / P> 
<P> 
International rights groups and media - freedom organisations have repeatedly accused Azerbaijan of curbing free speech by jailing journalists and adopting restrictive media laws .

Clinton was visiting the Azerbaijani capital Baku during a whirlwind tour of eastern European and Caucasus region countries . After visiting Ukraine , Poland and Azerbaijan , she was due later Sunday in Armenia and on Monday in Georgia .
