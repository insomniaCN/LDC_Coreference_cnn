Peace protestors camping in front of the British Parliament lost their appeal against eviction on Friday after the city 's mayor took legal action to have them removed .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Court of Appeal upheld an eviction order against the group who had set up the makeshift camp known as Democracy Village on public land in Parliament Square on May 1 .
< / P> 
<P> 
The activists , who are protesting against the war in Afghanistan and a range of other issues , argued that London mayor Boris Johnson did not have the authority to force them off the site .
< / P> 
<P> 
But in his ruling , David Neuberger , the Master of the Rolls and the second most senior judge in England and Wales , said that while the Crown owned the title to the land , the Mayor of London had been given power to act over the square .
< / P> 
<P> 
" They have been allowed to express their views and assemble together at the location of their choice , Parliament Square Gardens , for over two months on an effectively exclusive basis , " Neuberger said .
< / P> 
<P> 
He added the decision would not prevent the protestors from " mounting an orthodox demonstration " at the same site in the future .
< / P> 
<P> 
The protest group can now appeal the ruling in Britain 's Supreme Court .
< / P> 
<P> 
A spokesman for Johnson said the mayor respected the right to demonstrate but the protest had caused " considerable damage " to the square .
< / P> 
<P> 
He also said the presence of the protest camp had " prevented ( the square 's ) peaceful use by other Londoners , including those who may have wished to conduct an authorised protest " .
< / P> 
<P> 
" We would urge the protesters to respect the rulings of both courts and now leave the site peacefully , " he added .
