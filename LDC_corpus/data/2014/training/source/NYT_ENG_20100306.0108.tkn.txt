PATERSON REWARDS REDEMPTION WITH A PARDON 
< / HEADLINE> 
<TEXT> 
<P> 
Gov. David A . Paterson announced Saturday that he had pardoned a 
man whose rise from poverty and street crime in Chinatown to 
success as an information technology executive was about to end in 
deportation .
< / P> 
<P> 
The case of the man , Qing Hong Wu , who immigrated to the United 
States legally as a child , had drawn support from many , including 
the judge who sentenced him to a reformatory in 1996 and promised 
to stand by him if he redeemed himself .
< / P> 
<P> 
" Qing Hong Wu 's case proves that an individual can , with hard 
work and dedication , rise above past mistakes and turn his life 
around , " Paterson said of the pardon , which will stop deportation 
proceedings against Wu and could open the door to American 
citizenship .
< / P> 
<P> 
Supporters and relatives were jubilant on Saturday night .
< / P> 
<P> 
" First of all , we want to thank the governor for saving Qing 
Wu 's life , " said Elizabeth OuYang , the president of an 
Asian - American civil rights organization that led the campaign to 
free Wu from an immigration jail in New Jersey and keep him in the 
country .
< / P> 
<P> 
" It has been an amazing rainbow of people who have come 
together to stop his removal in the midst of a very broken 
immigration system , " she added .
< / P> 
<P> 
While Wu 's family and friends rejoiced , he remained in the 
Monmouth County Correctional Institute in Freehold , N . J . , unaware 
that his life had turned around once more .
< / P> 
<P> 
He was taken there from immigration headquarters in Manhattan on 
Nov . 10 . It was his application for citizenship that brought Wu , 
29 , to the attention of immigration authorities almost 15 years 
after he committed a series of muggings with other teenagers in 
Lower Manhattan . In a parallel system of immigration law 
enforcement that makes no allowances for rehabilitation , the court 
hearing his case had no discretion to consider the exemplary life 
he had led after emerging from the reformatory .
< / P> 
<P> 
As a " criminal alien , " he was subject to mandatory detention 
and deportation to China , which he had not seen since he was 5 and 
where he knew no one .
< / P> 
<P> 
OuYang said a full and unconditional pardon should not only 
prevent the federal government from deporting Wu , but should be 
grounds for granting him citizenship " so he can come full circle , 
where he started when this whole mess began . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
The pardon was announced at the conclusion of a tumultuous week 
for Paterson in which top aides resigned and he faced calls for his 
resignation over accusations that he had abused the powers of his 
office .
< / P> 
<P> 
Morgan Hook , a spokesman for the governor , said that " the 
federal government will be notified that he had been pardoned , and 
they will determine the next steps , as far as ending the removal 
proceedings and releasing him . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
The link between Wu and the judge who sentenced him , Michael A .
Corriero , was described in an article in The New York Times last 
month . Wu wrote to the now - retired judge from detention reminding 
him of the promises that they exchanged at his sentencing .
< / P> 
<P> 
Corriero had forgotten the case , but checked the old court 
transcripts and found that he had told Wu , then 16 , " This is 
really the beginning of a new period for you . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
" You will want to get a job and become a meaningful , 
constructive member of society to help your family . " The judge 
then added , " I will be there to make sure you can . " 
< / P> 
<P> 
After the article appeared , hundreds of readers signed an online 
petition urging that Paterson grant a pardon .
< / P> 
<P> 
The Manhattan district attorney , Cyrus Vance Jr . , called the 
governor express his approval of that course .
< / P> 
<P> 
In December , Paterson pardoned a soldier whose conviction for 
gun possession had prevented him from joining the New York Police 
Department . The soldier , Spc . Osvaldo Hernandez of Queens , had been 
arrested in 2002 after a pistol was found under a seat in his car .
< / P> 
<P> 
He joined the Army after his release from prison and served 15 
months in Afghanistan with the 82nd Airborne . After the pardon , he 
left for another tour there .
< / P> 
<P> 
In May 2008 , the hip - hop performer Ricky Walters , who had been 
convicted in 1991 of attempted murder and weapons offenses , was 
pardoned by the governor . Walters , known as Slick Rick , had also 
faced deportation , to Great Britain , because of his criminal 
record .
